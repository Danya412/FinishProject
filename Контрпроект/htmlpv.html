          <h2 class="h23-thk">Do Not Track</h2>
          <p class="p-thk">
            Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer, Firefox,
            and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a
            technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’
            visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting.
            Bruden Mode does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT
            signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no
            common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry
            groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent
            standard of interpreting user intent. Bruden Mode takes privacy and
            meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to
            monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
            implementation of a standard.
